    "# Dark Matter and Galaxy Formation 💫\n",
    "Author: Charles Gannon \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In terms of mass, galaxies are dominated by dark matter. In fact, it is believed that almost 97% of the Milky Way's mass is in dark matter (Wilkison et al. 1999, Licquia et al 2015). Galaxies sit in the middle of dark matter structures called dark matter halos (as shown below)\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/galaxy-diagram.png\" alt=\"Diagram of a galaxy in the middle of a dark matter halo\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "Even though dark matter is invisible, the structure of galaxies cannot be understood without the gravitational effects of dark matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we try to understand how galaxies form is by running simulations of the universe and studying how galaxies form.\n",
    "Because dark matter plays such a critical role in galaxy formation we often run simulations with *only* dark matter.\n",
    "In this notebook we will put on \"dark matter goggles\" and see what our galaxy would look like if we could see dark matter.\n",
    "We will analyze the output of *real* simulations of dark matter from the galacticus<sup>2, *</sup> (Benson 2012) galaxy formation model.\n",
    "Using these simulations, we will explore a key prediction of dark matter: dark matter halos grow by merging with other dark matter halos.\n",
    "We will explore the effects of dark matter mergers and look for the remnants of these mergers.\n",
    "Finally, we will discuss how might we look for these effects in the universe.\n",
    "\n",

    "in otherwords, the stellar mass of a galaxy is a monotonically increasing function of halo mass. \n",
    "In addition, the brightness or luminosity of a galaxy is increases with it's mass (more massive galaxies are brighter).\n",
    "We will use this fact to determine which subhalos host visible satellite galaxies.\n",

    "### Exercise\n",
    "Here we will consider the case where we pretend we are looking at our dark matter halos through the JWST or hubble space telescope (which ever you prefer).\n",
    "\n",
    "**key info:** In systems we are interested in, halos (and subhalos) with mass $m > 10^{12} M_\\odot$ will host galaxies that may be visible to us. Place a star at the location of each subhalo in the image below that has mass $m > 10^{12} M_\\odot$ on the **left** axis. \n",

    "#### Suggestions\n",
    "+ You can use ```zip()``` to iterate over multiple arrays at once.\n",
    "+ Changing ```nfilter=nfilter_halos``` to ```nfilter=nfilter_subhalos``` will select subhalos instead of the host halo\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "+ Sanity check: does everything seem right with our plots here?\n",
    "+ How many galaxies would we expect to see based on our simulation? How does it compare to the total number of subhalos? For the rest of the workshop, we will discuss how we can observe the rest of the subhalos we can't see through a telescope because their galaxies are too dim (or they are so low mass they don't host a galaxy at all!).\n",
    "+ When setting the size of the star, I use take the logarithm $\\left(\\log_{10} (m)\\right)$ of the subhalo's mass. Why not just use mass directly?\n",
    "+ A halo with mass $M = 10^{12} M_\\odot$ will host a galaxy of mass $M_\\star \\sim 10^{10} M_\\odot$. About how many stars are in this galaxy? Challenge: try to answer this without looking it up on google (or asking chatgpt) and without any math. Give a very approximate answer."

    "Subhalos also experience tidal due to the gravitational force of the host halo, and will lose large amounts of mass (On average, galacticus predicts a subhalo will lose around $97\\%$) of it's mass (Gannon et al. 2025). Below is a video of tidal stripping in action.\n",

    "The masses we were using to determine the brightnesses of galaxies are the mass of the subhalo *before* it is tidally stripped. This is correct because the galaxy will form before the subhalo merges with its host. \n",

    "This is why one of the dark matter halos we placed a star on was not very dense in our image.\n",
